Notes
-----

Technical:

* It's made in Pages version 7.3
* The template is layed out as two tables in centimeters. 
* The width of a normal template (47cm/18.5") would exceed the size of _A3_ (it might fit diagonally), so it's printed in two parts on A4 format.

Usage:

* Page size is _A4_. Some countries might ajust page size.
* I made it optional to use the "template holder pins" (marked by the lowercase letter `o` on the left and right of the template). If you

Photo's of these templates seem rare, so you can find some in the [images](images/) folder. Here is an index:

And from my personal collection (not for an AEK keyboard, but an overlay nonetheless) my WordPerfect 6 overlays ([both DOS and Windows; PDF](images/WordPerfect6_DOS_and_Windows_Overlay.pdf)):
